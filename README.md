ABSTRACT

Egg turning is unique to birds and critical for embryonic development in most avian species. Technology 
that can measure changes in egg orientation and temperature at fine temporal scales (1 Hz) was neither 
readily available nor small enough to fit into artificial eggs until recently. Here we show the utility 
of novel miniature data loggers equipped with 3-axis (i.e., triaxial) accelerometers, magnetometers, and 
a temperature thermistor to study egg turning behavior in free-ranging birds. Artificial eggs containing 
egg loggers were deployed in the nests of three seabird species for 1–7 days of continuous monitoring. 
These species (1) turned their eggs more frequently (up to 6.5 turns h−1) than previously reported for 
other species, but angular changes were often small (1–10° most common), (2) displayed similar mean 
turning rates (ca. 2 turns h−1) despite major differences in reproductive ecology, and (3) demonstrated 
distinct diurnal cycling in egg temperatures that varied between 1.4 and 2.4°C. These novel egg loggers 
revealed high-resolution, three-dimensional egg turning behavior heretofore never measured in wild birds. 
This new form of biotechnology has broad applicability for addressing fundamental questions in avian 
breeding ecology, life history, and development, and can be used as a tool to monitor birds that are 
sensitive to disturbance while breeding.
